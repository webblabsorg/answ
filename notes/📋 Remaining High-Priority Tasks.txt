📋 Remaining High-Priority Tasks

From the to-dos.md file, the next recommended tasks are:

Next Steps (High Impact, Moderate Effort):
1. Core Dashboard Enhancements - Add quick resume, streaks, goals, daily tasks to homepage
2. Citation Generator Tool - Create APA/MLA/Chicago citation generator with BibTeX export
3. Flashcards MVP - Build SRS flashcards with import/export

Medium Priority (Larger Features):
4. next-intl Integration - Full i18n setup (requires npm package installation)
5. Adaptive Practice Sessions - Mastery model + diagnostics (backend integration required)
6. Explanations Revamp - Multi-step solutions with citations

All improvements maintain:
•  Current black/gray/blue color scheme
•  Existing layout structure
•  Dark mode styling
•  Design consistency
